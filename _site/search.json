To check, let’s compare one column of the rotation matrix (say, the 3rd) with the corresponding eigenvector.\n\nplot( pca$rotation[,3], eig$vectors[,3], asp=1 )\n\n\n\n\nThe irlba function did not compute a full eigendecomposition but only calculated the first 20 eigenvectors. How can such a partial eigendecomposition be done?\nMost algorithms for partial eigendecompositions are refinements of a basic idea, the power method. The power method itself tends to not be very numerically stable, which is why much more stable variants have been developed. The irlba package, for example, used Baglama and Reichel’s “augmented implictly restarted Lanczoc bidiagonalization algroithm” (IRLBA).\nInstead of going into the depth of IRLBA and related approaches, we will only demonstrate the simple power method in the folloing.\nLet’s assume, the eigenvectors of our matrix \\(M=Y^\\top Y\\) were \\(\\mathbf{r}_l\\) with eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_l\\), i.e., \\(M\\mathbf{r}_l=\\lambda_l\\).\nWe start with a random vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). If we already knew the eigendecomposition of \\(M\\), we could use it as basis to expand \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) in it: \\(\\mathbf{v}=\\sum_l v_l \\mathbf{r}_l\\).\nApplying \\(M\\) gives \\(m\\mathbf{v}=\\sum_l \\lambda_l v_l \\mathbf{r}_l\\) and applying \\(M\\) \\(n\\) times yields \\[ M^n\\mathbf{v}=\\sum_l \\lambda_l^nv_l\\mathbf{r}_l\\] As \\(\\lambda_1\\) is the largest eigenvalue, the first component of \\(M^n\\mathbf{v}\\) will grow faster with \\(n\\) than the other components, and with increasing \\(n\\), the vector \\(M^n\\mathbf{v}\\) will become more and more collinear with the first eigenvector.\nWe try this by starting with a random vector, and applying the matrix 5 times. To avoid numerical overflow, we normalize the vector to unit length after each operation. Then, we compare the vector with the actual first eigenvector (as calculated by irlba) with a scatter plot.\n\nv &lt;- rnorm( length(hvg) )\nfor( i in 1:10 ) {\n  v &lt;- as.vector( yty %*% v )\n  v &lt;- v / sqrt(sum(v^2))\n  plot( pca$rotation[,\"PC1\"], v, asp=1, pch=\".\" )\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv1 &lt;- v\n\nTo get the second eigenvector, we do the same as before, but after each operation we subtract the vector’s projection onto the first eigenvector.\n\nv &lt;- rnorm( length(hvg) )\nfor( i in 1:10 ) {\n  v &lt;- as.vector( yty %*% v )\n  v &lt;- v - v1 * sum( v1 * v )\n  v &lt;- v / sqrt(sum(v^2))\n  plot( pca$rotation[,\"PC2\"], v, asp=1 )\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv2 &lt;- v\n\nBy projecting out the first two eigenvectors, we can get the third eigenvector:\n\nv &lt;- rnorm( length(hvg) )\nfor( i in 1:10 ) {\n  v &lt;- as.vector( yty %*% v )\n  v &lt;- v - v1 * sum( v1 * v )\n  v &lt;- v - v2 * sum( v2 * v )\n  v &lt;- v / sqrt(sum(v^2))\n  plot( pca$rotation[,\"PC3\"], v, asp=1 )\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs states, this simple method tends to become numerically unstable quickly. However, most partial eigendecomposition algorithms actually used build onto this basic idea."

However, is seems convenient to use a transformation that maps 0 to 0.

    "text": "DNA Sequencing\n\nSanger sequencing\n\nWith Sanger’s invention of what is now called Sanger sequencing (1977) it became possible to read off the sequence of DNA molecules. Typically, one can read several hundreds of bases from one end towards the other end.\nFor Sanger sequence, one needs a huge amount of copies of the same DNA fragments.\nFortunately, it is easy to exponentially amplify DNA with the polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) which is able to duplicate DNA molecules and so doubles the number of molecules in each reaction cycle.\nAvailability of commercial Sanger sequencers (from 1984 on) with read-out via fluorescent light (in 4 colours) made it possible to sequence, e.g., the entire human genome (“completed” 2003).\nSanger sequencing works in solution. The liquid solution must contain copies of only one sequence; as one otherwise gets an unreadable mixture of sequencing signals from the different sequences.\n\n\n\nHigh-throughput sequencing\n\nIn the early 2000s, ideas came up to fix the DNA fragments to a surface and perfrom the DNA such that the copies attach to the surface in clsoe proximity.\nThus, one can spread many different DNA fragments over the surface and amplify each fragment into a “cluster” of copies. As the surface offers space for millions of spatially separated clusters, one can obtain the sequences of millions of different DNA fragments in parallel.\nSuch high-throughput sequencing (HTS) machines became available in the 2000s and have sense continuously improved in throughput and cost effectiveness.\nThe method described above has been commercialized by Solexa, which was then bought by Illumina. It was not the first, but one of the first HTS methods. Illumina is still market leader for HTS machines.\nNow, it is possible to obtain a human subject’s (nearly) complete genome within two days for a few hundred euro.\nThe approach is to obtain DNA from many cells and fragment it into many pieces of a few hundred base-pairs (bp) length.\nThe number of sequencing reads that overlap a give base pair in the genome is Poisson distributed.\nThe expected number of fragments (the “coverage” rate) depends on the total number of sequencing reads obtained.\nTherefore, a trade-off has to be made between cost-effectiveness and completeness.\n\n\n\nTranscriptomics / RNA sequencing\n\nAll cells of an individual have the same DNA, but they differ vastly in shape and function. (Compare a blood cell with a skin cell.)\nThis is because different cells express (i.e., transcribe) different genes, because they need different proteins.\nWhich genes a cell expresses and to what extent is regulated by complicated biochemical reactions.\nHence, a cell’s type and state is reflected to a good extent by its RNA content, also called its “transcriptome”.\nTherefore, a comparably simple way to get a large amount of information about what is goin on in a biological sample is to extract the RNA from all the cells and sequence it.\nRNA can be readily transformed into complimentary DNA (using a process called reverse transcription, that can easily performed in vitro), and this DNA is the sequenced using HTS.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of RNA-Seq data\n\nWhen performin RNA sequencing, one obtains a very long list with sequences of the RNA fragments (the “reads”), typically as text file in FASTQ format.\nOne then aligns the reads to the genome: A special program, called a short-read aligner is used to search for the sequence of each read in the genome (i.e., in a reference assembly). Of course, the aligner has to search through the chromosome sequences and their reverse complements.\nThe aligner should be splice-aware, i.e., expect that a read might strecth over an intron and hence align to two places with a gap in between.\nThe aligner produces a file (typically in SAM format) that give for each read the position in the genome where the sequence matched. Typically, the chromosome name is given, the position in the chromosome (as an integer) where the read’s match starts, the strand (“+” for match to the sequence as given, “-” for match to the reverse complement), followed by information on skipped parts (introns), descripancies between reference and read (mismatched bases) etc.\nA portion of the reads will stay “unmapped” (i.e., the aligner could not find their sequence in the genome), and some reads might match several loci (positions) in the genome.\nUsing a genome annotation file (which contains the genetic coordinates of all genes with their transcripts and exons), another software then determines for each read which gene it is from.\nIn the end, we get for each gene a count: a number telling us how many sequencing reads were seen that mapped to this gene.\n\n\n\nBulk RNA-Seq\n\nUsually one performs RNA-Seq in order to compare the transcriptome of differend types of samples.\nFor example, one might compare tumor samples with samples from adjacent normal tissues. In order to make sure that results are general and not specific to on subject, one needs sample pairs from several, or, ideally, many, patients. Genes whose expression is constistently stronger in the tumor samples than in the corresponding normal samples might be the genes that cause the tumour’s malignancy.\nOther useful comparisons might be\n\nCompare tissue samples from mice that have been treated with some drug with “control mice” which have received a placebo, to see how the drug influences the cells’ function.\nCompare samples from different tissues, to understand the difference between them.\nand many more\n\nIn most cases, the goal is to find differentiaklly expressed genes (DGEs), i.e., genes whose expression strength differs in a consistent (i.e., statistically significant) manner between the sample groups\n\n\n\nSingle-cell RNA-Seq\n\nTissues comprise many cell types.\nFor example, skin contain keratinocyte (which make up the skin’s sturdy outer layer), other epithelial cells (comprising e.g. the soft lower layer), cells making up the hair follicles, even muscle cells that can raise the hairs and, of course, the endothelial cells that line the blood capillaries and the various blood cells inside these, as well as receptor and nerve cells so that we can sense touch, heat, cold and pain etc.\nIf we find genes that are differentially expressed between, say, healthy skin and skin affected by a disease – which of these cell types is affected? Is the gene upregulated (i.e., expressed more strongly) in all cell types or only in some.\nWe would need to know which of the sequencing reads come from which cell.\n\nIn single-cell RNA-Seq we can tell whether two reads come from the same cell or from two different cells.\nThere are at least three possible ways to achieve this. - Plate-based methods: A microtiter plate is used (a grid-like arrangement of many miniature “test tubes” called “wells”) and a flow cytometer is used to place exactly one cell into each well. - Microfluidic methods: An emulsion of water droplets in oil is produced using microfluidics such that each water-in-oil droplet contains (ideally) at most one cell. - Combinatorial indexing: We skip the explanation for these.\nEach compartment (well or droplet) gets a “DNA barcode oligo”: a short piece of DNA with a random sequence that gets incorporated into the cDNA during reverse transcription. Thus, each sequenced fragment contains teh sequence of the RNA fragment, together with this “cell barcode” that identifies the compartment (and hence the cell) that the read came from.\nWe will get back to details on how this works.\n\n\nPreprocessing of single-cell RNA-Seq data\n\nAs before, each reads gets aligned to the genome. Afterwards, the gene that the read maps to is identified.\nAdditionally, the cell barcode is analysed. A list of all cell barcodes that appear in the sample is generated, and each read is assigned to one element in this list.\nThe final result is a count matrix:\n\nThe rows of the matrix correspond to genes.\nThe columns correspond to cell barcodes and hence cells.\nThe matrix entries tell how many reads have been found that mapped to this gene and seemed to originated from the cell with this barcode.\n\n\nThere are a number of complications that we will need to discuss: - A barcode may be corrupted by a read error, causing a read to be assigned to the wrong cell. - A compartment may not have contained a cell but still contained a few RNA molecules that were present in the solution, stemming from destroyed cells with broken cell membrane. Such barcode will have very few reads assigned to them, and we have to recognize them as not being cells. - A compartment might have contained more than one cell, and thus a mixture of RNA from several cells of possibly different type. This is called a “doublet”.\nThe main issue, however, is: The process is very lossy. A typical mammalian cell contains a several hundred thousands of mRNA molecules, but we usually only get a few thousand (microfluidics methods) or at best up to around 20,000 reads (plate-based methods).\nWhich molecules get sequenced is a random process, and we need to take care of the “counting noise” thus produced.\nMany genes are produced by the cells at very low copy numbers, and with the selection during sequencing, we will very frequently end up with a zero count. The count matrix is therefore very sparse (i.e., a large fraction of the matrix elements have the value 0)."

    "text": "This document lists some basic facts on molecular biology for the non-biologists in the audience – even though you should remember these points from high school.\n\nDNA\n\nA cell’s genetic information is stored in its DNA (desoxyrobonucleic acids). DNA is a polymer, i.e., it is made as a long chain of repeating elements, the nucleotides, which are linked by phosphate bonds.\nThere are four nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). The information stored in the DNA is represented by the sequence of these elements.\nDNA is a double-helix, comprising two strands running in opposite direction whose bases are paired up (base pairing). Adenine always pairs with thymine (AT), cytosine with guanine (CG.\nTherefore, the sequences of the two strands are related to each othe by the operation of reverse complementation, i.e., reversing the sequence, and replacing each base by its complementary base (i.e., swapping A↔︎Tv and G↔︎T). Example:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; AGGCTCAGT &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;   (first strand, read from left to right)\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; TCCGAGTCA &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   (second strand, read from right to left)\n\nEach base pair (bp) in the genome contains 2 bit of information.\nTo make copies of DNA, the cell uses enzymes called polymerases which seperate the two strands and use one of the strands as “template” to assemble a new strand by base-pairing.\nPolymerases are used to duplicate the DNA for cell division, and to make RNA (see below).\nIn eukaryotes (cells with proper cellular nucleus), DNA is organized in chromosomes: long linear chains. In procaryotes (bacteria and archae, which do not have a nucleus), DNA forms a loop. Eukaryotes also contain mitochondriae (abbreviated MT) which contain a DNA loop like prokaryotes.\nThe chromosomes are numbered (for humans: from 1 to 22) except for the sex chromosomes, which are denoted X and Y.\nA reference assembly is a set of sequences for a species’ chromosomes that is used to describe a “typical” or “average” individual’s DNA.\nThere are databases that describe which parts of the DNA sequence is the same in (nearly) all individuals and which parts tend to vary between individuals (polymorphisms).\n\n\n\nRNA\n\nIn order to “make use of”work” with DNA, the cell can make a copy of a defined stretch of the DNA. This copy is made as RNA, a chemical variant of DNA, and is single-stranded, i.e. not a double helix.\nIn RNA, the base thymine (T) is replaced by uracil (U).\nThe process of making an RNA copy of DNA is called transcription, the produced RNA is called a transcript.\nA region of DNA that is regularly transcribed to RNA is called a gene.\nAn important class of transcripts are those that conatin “blueprints” for proteins. The genes producing these are called protein-coding genes.\n\n\n\nDirections\n\nChromosomes have a special region in the middle called the centromer that divides the chromsome into two arms. By convention, the shorter arm (p arm) is on the left, and the base pairs are numbered from left to right, starting either with 1 or 0.\nIn RNA, sequences are written in the same order in which they are chained by the polymerase and read by the ribosome. The start is called the 5’ end, the end (in reading direction) is called the 3’ end.\n\n\n\nProteins\n\nProteins are polymeric macromolecules formed from chains of amino acids.\nProteins that catalyze chemical reactions are called enzymes. They are the molecular machines that make living cells possible.\nStructural proteins, in contrast, are building blocks for the cells structure.\nProteins are polymers of basic building blocks, the amino acids (AAs), that are connected via the so-called peptide bond.\nThere are 20 proteinogenic amino acids (+2 special ones).\nA protein is defined by the sequence of these amino acids.\nA special molecular machine, the ribosome, assembles proteins by chaining together individual amino acids. It reads of the requried sequence of the amino acids from an RNA transcript called a messenger RNA.\nThis process is called translation\nWhile the linear AA chain is assembled the nascent protein folds into a complicated 3D shape that is crucial for its function. This happens due to chemical attractions and repulsions between the amino acids in the chain and between an amino acid and the surrounding water molecules.\nThe amino acids all differ in their chemical properties, thus making a wide variety of such interactions possible.\n\n\n\nThe genetic code\n\nAn RNA transcript that can be processed by a ribosome to build a protein is called “messenger RNA” (mRNA).\nIt contains a sequence of groups of three bases each, called codons. Each of the \\(4^3\\) possible codons codes for an amino acid, except for the stop codon that instructs the ribosome to finish the translation and release the finished protein.\nAs there are 20 amino acids (and the stop signal), the code is redundant: For each meaning there are 2 to 4 codons.\nHere is the genetic code.\n\n\n\nTranscript types\nThere are several types of genes/transcripts:\n\nProtein-coding genes are transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), which are read by ribosomes and serve as “blueprint” for assembling proteins.\n\nAn mRNA transcript has three parts: The part in the middle is called the coding sequence (CDS), which contains the sequence of codons, always starting with AUG (the codon for methionine, that also serves as start signal).\nThe part before the transcription start signal is called the 5’ untranslated region (5’-UTR).\nThe part after the stop codon is called the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR).\nIn most cases, the 3’ UTR is followed by a multiple adenines, called the poly-A tail.\n\nOther transcripts are called non-coding. There are several:\n\nRibosomal genes are transcribed to ribosomal RNA (rRNA). These fold into a special shape that can catalyze reactions (a ribozyme) and form the core of the ribosome. The vast majority of a cell’s RNA is rRNA.\nTransfer RNA (tRNA) are short pieces of RNA that hold individual amino acids and supply them to the ribosomes.\nsmall nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have a role in splicing (see below).\nmicro-RNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are various other RNA that have regulatory roles, e.g., they influence how often a messenger transcript gets translated before it gets degraded.\n\n\n\n\nSplicing and isoforms\n\nWhile a (protein coding or a long non-coding) gene is transcribed, a machinery called the spliceosome cuts out large parts of the produced transcripts, reducing the initial “pre-mRNA” to a much shorter “mature mRNA”. The removed parts are called introns, the remaining parts (that are chained together) are called exons. The places wher the RNA is cut are called splice sites.\nDepending on many factors, one gene can give rise to different transcripts (transcript isoforms) that differ in where the transcription starts, where is terminates (or: where the poly-A tail is attached) and which splice sites are used.\nA “gene model” is teh information what isoforms have been observed to be produced by a gene. A collection of models for all genes, togetehr with the transcript types (see above) is called a “gene annotation” for a reference assembly."

This means that the points have been arranged such that cells that are similar appear close to each other while cells that are very different are put far apart from each other.\nWe will discuss soon in detail how such dimension reduction works and, importantly, what is meant by “similar”.\nSeurat has also run a “clustering” algorithm that assigns the cells to different “clusters” of cells that are similar to each other. Colours are used here to indicate cluster membership.\nWe observe that the cells fall into three big groups that each split into a number of smaller clusters.\n\nIdentifying cell types\nWe suspect that these represent different types of white blood cells. There should be B-cells, T-cells and perhaps monocytes.\nT cells are defined as white blood cells that show a the T-cell receptor as their surface, a protein complex made up of various proteins, one of which is called the T-cell receptor epsilon chain. This protein is described for the gene CD3E. We can ask Seurat to indicate the read counts for this gene in the UMAP plot:\n\nFeaturePlot( seu, \"CD3E\")\n\n\n\n\nWe conclede that clusters 0 and 3 are probably the T cells.\nWe can also colour for CD79A, a marker for B cells:\n\nFeaturePlot( seu, \"CD79A\")\n\n\n\n\nTo find out what the group to the left is, we can go another way. Let’s ask Seurat to find genes that are expressed much mroe strongly in clusters 1 and 4 than in clusters 0, 2, 3, 5:\n\nFindMarkers( seu, ident.1=c(1,4), ident.2=c(0,2,3,5), test.use=\"t\" ) -&gt; m\nhead( m, 50 )\n\n                 p_val avg_log2FC pct.1 pct.2     p_val_adj\nLST1      0.000000e+00  5.2602174 0.969 0.147  0.000000e+00\nCST3      0.000000e+00  5.6816322 0.994 0.193  0.000000e+00\nTYROBP    0.000000e+00  4.5599105 0.995 0.194  0.000000e+00\nFCER1G    0.000000e+00  3.9303734 0.953 0.153  0.000000e+00\nAIF1      0.000000e+00  4.8394973 0.968 0.171  0.000000e+00\nPTPRCAP   0.000000e+00 -4.3390790 0.123 0.820  0.000000e+00\nLGALS1    0.000000e+00  3.5888431 0.982 0.303  0.000000e+00\nCTSS      0.000000e+00  3.3704116 0.956 0.370  0.000000e+00\nIL32      0.000000e+00 -4.5060681 0.123 0.703  0.000000e+00\nS100A11   0.000000e+00  2.9021375 0.959 0.381  0.000000e+00\nLYZ       0.000000e+00  5.5523830 0.995 0.471  0.000000e+00\nSAT1      0.000000e+00  3.1880331 0.972 0.454  0.000000e+00\nCOTL1     0.000000e+00  2.9140976 0.974 0.505  0.000000e+00\nS100A6    0.000000e+00  2.4265040 0.992 0.712  0.000000e+00\nS100A4    0.000000e+00  2.1051825 1.000 0.752  0.000000e+00\nOAZ1      0.000000e+00  1.9165328 0.995 0.877  0.000000e+00\nFTL       0.000000e+00  3.6241681 1.000 0.983  0.000000e+00\nFTH1      0.000000e+00  3.1675076 1.000 0.984  0.000000e+00\nCD3D     4.886112e-319 -4.3674643 0.092 0.670 1.599615e-314\nTYMP     3.882155e-306  4.2566370 0.926 0.151 1.270940e-301\nS100A9   1.783818e-297  7.0670428 0.962 0.154 5.839865e-293\nPSAP     1.902707e-294  2.9956639 0.934 0.359 6.229083e-290\nFCN1     9.535250e-274  5.5804410 0.896 0.092 3.121650e-269\nCYBA     8.453508e-272  1.5333488 0.991 0.797 2.767510e-267\nMALAT1   1.181579e-262 -1.5311747 1.000 1.000 3.868252e-258\nLTB      4.335583e-260 -3.5012014 0.348 0.824 1.419383e-255\nNPC2     1.360721e-240  3.2405179 0.896 0.252 4.454729e-236\nCD3E     8.066458e-236 -3.7395374 0.104 0.612 2.640797e-231\nCFD      7.012340e-210  5.9290434 0.822 0.036 2.295700e-205\nS100A8   1.234624e-205  7.2702939 0.855 0.084 4.041912e-201\nHLA-DRA  9.958375e-200  0.9548420 0.945 0.423 3.260173e-195\nGABARAP  3.036143e-190  2.4215683 0.881 0.351 9.939724e-186\nCD7      2.761808e-188 -4.2406042 0.058 0.475 9.041608e-184\nGSTP1    8.906341e-186  2.9200924 0.877 0.315 2.915758e-181\nRPS27    6.463844e-178 -1.2827741 0.988 0.998 2.116133e-173\nCD68     5.216417e-175  5.1623519 0.757 0.039 1.707751e-170\nGPX1     2.638599e-174  3.1465728 0.853 0.267 8.638245e-170\nSERPINA1 5.945946e-174  4.6390651 0.770 0.069 1.946584e-169\nLCK      2.819845e-170 -3.6083579 0.058 0.464 9.231609e-166\nNEAT1    1.968831e-169  1.8285530 0.928 0.540 6.445560e-165\nRPL3     5.794248e-169 -1.1390928 0.994 0.999 1.896921e-164\nPYCARD   8.652551e-167  2.7349426 0.824 0.215 2.832672e-162\nLGALS2   4.290216e-165  6.6287302 0.743 0.029 1.404531e-160\nRPL13A   9.270560e-165 -0.8866787 1.000 1.000 3.034996e-160\nRPS27A   2.750106e-158 -1.7498987 0.911 0.996 9.003298e-154\nCD2      8.578003e-155 -4.2838412 0.052 0.407 2.808267e-150\nRAC1     1.921305e-154  2.2617174 0.845 0.294 6.289968e-150\nCXCR4    2.275604e-153 -2.6822981 0.285 0.701 7.449873e-149\nRPL23A   2.157301e-152 -1.2329204 0.980 0.997 7.062571e-148\nTKT      2.978425e-152  2.8123604 0.793 0.200 9.750769e-148\n\n\nFrom this list, an immunologist would quickly see that these cells are monocytes.\n\n\nBack to math\nWhat is happening inside Seurat.\nA few questions we might have:\n\nHow do we define “similarity” of cells?\nEach cell is represented by a vector of count values. Can we simply define a metric or distance measure in that space to quantify similarity?\nIt will turn out that this does not work, due to the counting noise. Why?\nHow can we make cells with differing total read count comparable?\nWe will overcome the count-noise issue by performing a principal component analysis (a matrix decomposition based on the eigendecomposition). Why does that work?\nThe cells seem to be living in a high-dimensional space. Can this really be faithfully shown by a two-dimensional plot? How do we check the faithfulness? Here, we will get into a rabbit hole involving multi-variate optimization, metrics in distribution spaces, interactive visualizations and maybe GPU programming.\nHow to suitable define “clusters” of similar cells? This will lead us to applications of graph theory.\n\n\n\nThe manifold hypothesis\nA teaser to the core idea in single-cell analysis:\nCells “live” in a “state space” that is spanned by all the possible configurations of the cells in the organism. When a cell reacts to a stimulus or changes its state for another reason, this will be a continuous (maybe even smooth?) move in this statespace.\nHowever, we cannot observe the state space directly – but we assume that each state is associated with a transcriptome, i.e., a measure or distribution in the space of read count vectors spanned by the genes (i.e., of possible columns in the count matrix).\nWe assume that the distribution of the cells in our sample lives on a manifold in state space, and we wish to learn first the topology of this manifold, then gain a metric and an atlas for it, then infer the distribution/measure on this manifold, from which our cells have been sampled. And finally, we have to translate this mathematical description into a biological insights."
